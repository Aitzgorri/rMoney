# Implementation Plan

> Remaining feature work, ordered by recommended implementation sequence.
> When an item is fully implemented, **remove it** from this file.
> Items are grouped by spec but ordered by cross-spec dependencies and shared-code opportunities.

**Last shipped: v0.36.0** — bundles Phase 38 (June 2026 adjustments): the 430–439 review batch (SPEC-020 dividend tweaks, SPEC-034 cash-impact header alignment, SPEC-017 currency conversion, SPEC-029 ticker resolution, SPEC-021 responsive polish) plus the same-day Buy-Sell Planning cash-impact follow-up (FX triangulation, two-column overspend, global-pass cascade ordering, held-balance currency display, End sub-cent snap). Backup format advanced to `rmoney-data-v4` (`settings.favoriteCountries`). The earlier v0.35.0 bundled Phase 34a (transaction-edit correctness), Phase 35a (cross-currency fee model), Phase 36a–g (Finnhub/Stooq adapters, API-detected splits, stock-exchange selector, default CSV template, standalone lot picker), and Phase 37a–b — backup `rmoney-data-v3`. Full sub-phase breakdown lives in `RELEASE.md` and the git history; line-by-line acceptance criteria are removed from this plan once a release is closed.

**Next up:** Phase 20 future asset classes — **Crypto is now spec'd ([SPEC-036](features/SPEC-036-crypto-holdings.md), `ready`)** and is the next implementation target; bonds/metals/options remain sketches in SPEC-035. (Phase 21b Mobile Investments parity shipped 2026-06-02; deferred mobile items 228a/228b live in SPEC-030.)

## Shared code — utilities pending extraction

> All other shared utilities (currency conversion cache, market data client, inline form expansion, AI connection, `cashMovements` ledger, HybridFilterDropdown, CurrencyToggle, CurrencyDropdown, ConfigurableTable, soft-delete lifecycle, XIRR, persisted-history-vs-hot-cache split, drag-and-drop tree, planning-period calculation, frequency math, one-time/regular toggle) are extracted as shared modules. See `app/src/components/` and `app/src/utils/` for paths. Two remain inline:

| Utility | Status | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hierarchical tree component | inline | Used in Categories + Envelopes screens | Review for SPEC-009 (planned expenses) generalisation if/when that phase resumes |
| Cascade-delete confirmation dialog | inline | Used in Categories + Envelopes | Extract before SPEC-009 needs it |

## Pending items from earlier phases

### Recommended order (logical / technical dependencies)

Reordered after v0.34.0 to put small correctness fixes first, then the cohesive cross-currency overhaul, then capability expansion (adapters → features that need them), then security follow-ups, then polish. Items keep their original numbers + spec grouping so `plan:validate` stays in sync.

1. **Tier 1 — Transaction-edit correctness + safety** ✓ done (291, 165, 286 all shipped in Phase 34a).
2. **Tier 2 — Cross-currency model overhaul** ✓ done (152j-full, 152m-full, 159b, 164, 288 all shipped in Phase 35a).
3. **Tier 3 — Market data adapters** ✓ done (157f Finnhub + 157g Stooq both shipped in Phase 36). Unblocks the splits notification in Tier 4. (Note: 255 IBKR OAuth in Tier 5 depends on a separate IBKR adapter that is currently a stub, not on Finnhub/Stooq.)
4. **Tier 4 — Splits + exchange UX** ✓ done (170 API-detected splits shipped in Phase 36d; 185 stock-exchange selector in Phase 36c).
5. **Tier 5 — Security follow-ups** — 237a closed in Phase 36e (Settings → AI hostname allowlist; meta-CSP approach abandoned after research, see SPEC-031). 255 stays gated on the IBKR adapter being built (currently a stub) and IBKR retail OAuth shipping.
6. **Tier 6 — Small UX polish** ✓ done (152 default CSV template selector shipped in Phase 36f; 382 standalone lot-picker shipped in Phase 36g).

Every Tier (1–6) of the post-v0.34.0 backlog is now closed. The only items remaining below are the long-deferred IBKR OAuth slot (gated on third-party availability) and the placeholder phases (20 future asset classes, 21b mobile parity).

### SPEC-031 Security and secrets handling (Phase 24 leftovers)
255. [ ] When IBKR retail OAuth ships, tokens go straight to Stronghold under `marketData/ibkr/oauth/{accessToken,refreshToken}` — gated on the IBKR adapter actually being built (currently a stub).

## Phase 38 — June 2026 adjustments (shipped in v0.36.0)

> Batch from the **01 June 2026** review notes — **implemented 2026-06-01; app compiles clean**. All ten items (430–439) are built; per-item acceptance criteria now live (checked) in their specs: SPEC-020 (430, 431), SPEC-034 (432, 433), SPEC-017 (434–437), SPEC-029 (438), SPEC-021 (439). The numbered work items were removed from this list per the "remove implemented items" rule; this stub remains only to carry the release obligation below.
>
> **Cash-impact follow-up batch (SPEC-034, 2026-06-01, also Phase 38):** a second same-day round on the Buy-Sell Planning cash-impact table, prompted by user-reported overspend/FX bugs. All built and checked in SPEC-034: (a) FX triangulation through the main currency so a held balance with no direct pair to the trade currency (e.g. GBP vs a USD buy when EUR is main) is reachable by the cascade; (b) two-column overspend — "Overspend (own cash)" (per-currency standalone) kept, plus a new "Overspend (after FX, {main})" residual consolidated into the main currency; (c) the cash cascade now runs as three **global** priority passes (all buys claim own trade-currency cash → main → others) instead of per-buy, so growing a native-currency buy correctly shrinks that currency's borrowed-out leg; (d) held-balance currencies now appear in the currency-display picker and default cash-impact table; (e) sub-cent End values snap to 0 to avoid a spurious red "-0.00"; (f) the dividend-impact aggregate is robust to a missing trade→main FX rate — a dividend-paying row in an unrated currency still contributes its yield % (approximate weighting, "~" marker) instead of being silently dropped to 0.00, with the main-currency amounts flagged partial and a footnote naming the missing pair. **No data-shape change** — all compute/display only; `displayedCurrencies` already existed in the scenario schema, so this adds **no** new backup-format obligation.
>
> **Release obligation (v0.36.0):** item 435 added a new settings key (`settings.favoriteCountries`) — a data-shape change. When v0.36.0 is cut, bump the backup format to **`rmoney-data-v4`** and update the RELEASE.md *Data compatibility* table. The key rides inside the existing `rmoney_settings` blob, so **no new Settings → Storage card** is required (same as `favoriteCurrencies`). The cash-impact follow-up batch above adds nothing further to this obligation.
>
> **Tagging note (v0.36.0):** the version-bump commit (`Release v0.36.0`, `911d63d`) landed **before** the Phase 38 dividend/UI polish commits, and the locally-built v0.36.0 installers were rebuilt to include that polish. So when the `v0.36.0` git tag is cut, **tag the tip of the Phase 38 polish work, not `911d63d`** — otherwise the tag would point at code older than the shipped installers. (User asked to record this; they'll request the tag when ready.)
>
> **Note on item 433:** no code change was needed — the existing sells-before-buys cascade in `simulateCashImpact()` already nets sell proceeds against buy FX legs (verified against the worked example: GBP £0 + EUR €1000, buy £500, sell £400 → GBP £0, EUR out only €117.65).

## Phase 20 — Future asset classes (placeholder slots)

> Reserved slots in the investment-type filter so the reports UI is complete from day one. Each asset class gets its own spec round later with type-specific fields and lifecycle.
>
> **Roadmap and design questions:** see [SPEC-035 Asset class roadmap](features/SPEC-035-asset-class-roadmap.md). Suggested build order: crypto → bonds → metals storage → metals lease → options. Each graduates to its own full spec (`SPEC-036+`) before implementation begins.

220. [ ] **Options** — strike, expiry, underlying, exercise/assignment lifecycle, greeks tracking — see SPEC-035 § Options
221. [ ] **Bonds** — coupon, yield, maturity, accrued interest, amortization — see SPEC-035 § Bonds
222. [~] **Crypto** — IN PROGRESS: graduated to **[SPEC-036 Crypto holdings](features/SPEC-036-crypto-holdings.md)** (`ready`, 2026-06-02). Spot buy/sell/swap/transfer + lots, reusing the stock model (shared `rmoney_stock_transactions` + `assetClass` tag; wallet = attribute; dedicated `swap`/`transfer` types; CoinGecko adapter). 21 acceptance criteria; staking + on-chain fee attribution out of scope for v1. Cross-spec work: SPEC-027 adapter, SPEC-029 resolution, SPEC-031 CSP host, SPEC-024 reports, SPEC-016 backup-format bump evaluation.
223. [ ] **Precious metals (storage)** — quantity, weight unit, purity, storage cost, no yield — see SPEC-035 § Precious metals — storage
224. [ ] **Precious metals (lease)** — counterparty, lease rate, payout cadence, principal return date — see SPEC-035 § Precious metals — lease

### SPEC-036 Crypto holdings — build order (active)

> Sequenced for dependencies: data layer first (so the lot engine stays correct), then pricing, then the surfaces that consume both. Full per-criterion contract lives in [SPEC-036](features/SPEC-036-crypto-holdings.md); these are the build steps.

1. [x] **Asset-class tagging (D6)** — data layer done: `ASSET_CLASS` + `assetClassOf()` (absent ⇒ stock) in `stockTransactions.js`, with an `assetClass` param (default stock) threaded through `getStockTransactionsByTicker` / `getAllKnownTickers` / `hasOpenLotsForTicker` / `getOpenLots` / `getPositions`. Existing callers unchanged; crypto is opt-in. Build passes. *(Consumer-side crypto display is item 8; write-side `assetClass:'crypto'` is item 2.)*
2. [x] **Crypto buy/sell + `wallet` field (D1)** — data-layer write-side done: `createBuy`/`createSell` take `assetClass` (default stock) + `wallet`, stamping crypto-only fields so stock records stay byte-identical; `createSell`'s default FIFO allocation is scoped to crypto lots; cash-movement/FX path reused unchanged. `updateBuy`/`updateSell` gained an optional `wallet` override. Fractional quantities flow through. Build passes. *(The crypto entry FORM that calls these is item 2b.)*
2b. [ ] **Crypto buy/sell entry form (UI)** — add a crypto mode to the buy/sell entry forms (in `InvestingAccountDetail.jsx`): `wallet` input in the `exchange` slot, fractional-quantity input, coin selection via the SPEC-029 resolver (item 7). Calls the step-2 `createBuy`/`createSell` with `assetClass:'crypto'`.
3. [x] **`swap` transaction type (D2)** — data layer done: `createSwap` writes the atomic record + FROM-leg FIFO allocation over crypto lots; `getOpenLots` consumes the FROM coin and synthesizes a TO-leg lot (`${swapId}:to`) at `spotValue/qty` (chained swaps work); `getPositions`/`getAllKnownTickers` discover swap-acquired coins; net fiat = 0 (only optional `swap-fee`); delete guards added for both legs. Build passes; stock queries unaffected. *(Realised-P/L figure + report/Buy-Sell surfaces = item 4; swap edit form = a UI step.)*
4. [x] **`swap` consumers** — audit + ledger robustness. Inventory quantities already correct via the step-3 lot engine. Existing reports / portfolio history / Buy-Sell planning all query the default `stock` class, so swaps can neither appear nor corrupt stock numbers; their crypto-surfacing display folds into item 8. The app has no named realised-P/L figure (stocks included), so there is none to make swap-aware. Concrete fix: `InvestingAccountDetail` labels the `swap-fee` cash movement, makes it filterable, and renders it standalone (kept out of `FEE_TYPES`). Build passes.
5. [x] **wallet `transfer` record (D3)** — coarse-label model (decided 2026-06-03): holdings tracked per (account, coin), not per wallet. `createWalletTransfer` writes a distinct `type:'wallet-transfer'` audit record (ticker, quantity, fromWallet, toWallet) — no lot consumption, no cash movement, no P/L. `getOpenLots`/`canDelete` have no branch for it, so total holdings are unchanged with zero engine change; deletion works via the generic path. Per-wallet live balances + transfer-fee attribution deferred (out of scope v1). Spec D3 updated to match. Build passes.
6. [ ] **CoinGecko adapter (D5)** — register under the SPEC-027 client (spot + historical, keyless); add `api.coingecko.com` to static CSP `connect-src` (SPEC-031); no URL/key logging.
7. [ ] **Crypto ticker→coin resolution (SPEC-029)** — disambiguate symbols (e.g. `BTC → bitcoin`); stablecoins price ~1.00 with no peg map (D4).
8. [ ] **Reporting & display** — crypto in inventory + Investment Reports valued via FX into the portfolio total/weight; asset-class filter separates crypto from stocks.
9. [ ] **Backup-format evaluation (SPEC-016)** — assess `rmoney-data-v4 → v5` bump for the new types/fields; update RELEASE.md *Data compatibility* table and relabel the existing stock-transactions Storage card to show the crypto/stock split.

## Phase 21b — Mobile Investments parity (IN PROGRESS)

> Phase 21a (Android build pipeline) shipped in v0.34.0. Phase 21b closes the Investments-screen mobile gap. **Re-grounded 2026-06-02:** a code-level mobile audit (recorded in SPEC-028) found that the shared responsive components + Phase 37b already satisfy news, AI evaluation, and basic chart rendering. SPEC-028 is now `ready` with criteria rewritten to match reality. Remaining work is below.

### SPEC-028 Mobile Investments Parity — ✓ complete (2026-06-02)
All criteria met. The audit found the shared responsive components already covered news, AI evaluation, chart rendering, **and** the Investment Reports screen (it stacks below 1024px via `useMediaQuery(DESKTOP)` — the responsive work is in JS, not CSS). The only code written for this phase was the **chart mobile polish**: wrap + touch-size the period selector, and a phone-width `380×220` viewBox so axis labels stay legible (`PHONE` breakpoint added to `utils/mediaQuery.js`). See SPEC-028 for the per-criterion record.

### Moved out of Phase 21b → tracked in SPEC-030 § Mobile parity (deferred)
- 228a Watchlists & alerts on mobile, and 228b Tauri local notifications — these belong to the watchlists feature, not the Investments-screen rendering work. Still deferred.

# Release strategy

GitHub releases are tracked separately in [`RELEASE.md`](../RELEASE.md). Summary:

- **Versioning:** SemVer 0.X.Y, marked "Pre-release" on GitHub until the project is feature-complete enough for 1.0.
- **Cadence:** one tag per completed phase milestone (e.g. `v0.32.0` for the Phase 32 milestone, `v0.34.0` bundled all of Phase 33 + Phase 21a). Patch tags (`v0.X.1`, `v0.X.2`) for bug-fix-only releases between phases.
- **Platforms today:** Windows desktop (Tauri `.msi` + NSIS `.exe`) and Android (`.apk`, built via Capacitor). Linux/macOS desktop added when their build pipelines come online.
- **Process today:** fully manual local build + manual `gh release create`. GitHub Actions is documented as the next-step migration path in `RELEASE.md`.
